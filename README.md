# Bear Skin 8

Bear Skin is the default theme for the [Bear](https://github.com/zivtech/bear) profile, which is a Drupal starter kit installation profile that can be used for building a new Drupal site. Bear Skin does not rely on the profile. Therefore, it **can be used as a standalone [starter theme](https://www.drupal.org/node/323993)**.

## Getting started

Before getting started, make sure that you have the latest version of node.js and [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) installed. It is preferred to install node via [n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n) using `curl -L http://git.io/n-install | bash`.  

Also, you will need to have [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) installed. On a Mac, this is easiest with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
